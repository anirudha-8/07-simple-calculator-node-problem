# 🌟 Problem 7: Command-Line Calculator 🌟

Welcome to the seventh challenge in the Node.js practical problem series! 🚀 In this task, you'll build a simple and interactive **command-line calculator** using Node.js. This project will give you hands-on experience with parsing command-line arguments and performing basic arithmetic operations.

---

## 📝 Problem Statement

Write a Node.js script that functions as a command-line calculator. The script should take three arguments:

1. An operator (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).
2. The first number.
3. The second number.

The script should perform the requested operation and display the result.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Learn how to access and parse command-line arguments using `process.argv`.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations in JavaScript.
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs and operations.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Your project folder should look like this:

```bash
problem-7-calculator/
├── calculator.js     # The main script for the command-line calculator
├── README.md         # Documentation for this problem
└── package.json      # Project configuration file
```

🌟 Features to Enhance
Once you've completed the basics, try adding:

-Error Handling: Validate user inputs and provide meaningful error messages for invalid numbers or operators.

-Advanced Operations: Extend the calculator to support modulus, exponentiation, and square root operations.

-Interactive Mode: Allow users to provide inputs interactively (using the `readline` module).

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to use `process.argv` to access command-line arguments in Node.js.

- Perform basic arithmetic operations in JavaScript.

- Best practices for handling edge cases and invalid input.
